# SID and CIA Reference

## SID 6581/8580 — `$D400-$D418` (write-only except `$D419-$D41C`)

Per voice *n* (voice 1 base `$D400`, voice 2 `$D407`, voice 3 `$D40E`):

| Offset | Register | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0 / +1 | FREQ lo / hi | 16-bit frequency. `Fout = FREQ * clock / 16777216` (PAL clock 985248 Hz, NTSC 1022730 Hz) |
| +2 / +3 | PW lo / hi | 12-bit pulse width; `$800` = square. Only used by the pulse waveform |
| +4 | CONTROL | bit 7 noise, 6 pulse, 5 sawtooth, 4 triangle, 3 test, 2 ring mod, 1 sync, **0 gate** |
| +5 | ATTACK/DECAY | attack in the high nibble, decay in the low nibble (0 fastest, 15 slowest) |
| +6 | SUSTAIN/RELEASE | sustain **level** high nibble, release **rate** low nibble |

| Addr | Register | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `$D415` | FC lo | filter cutoff, low 3 bits |
| `$D416` | FC hi | filter cutoff, high 8 bits (this is the one you sweep) |
| `$D417` | RES/FILT | resonance in the high nibble; low nibble routes voice 1/2/3 and ext into the filter (bits 0-3) |
| `$D418` | MODE/VOL | bit 7 voice 3 off, bit 6 high-pass, bit 5 band-pass, bit 4 low-pass, bits 3-0 master volume |
| `$D419/$D41A` | POTX/POTY | paddle inputs (read) |
| `$D41B` | OSC3 | voice 3 oscillator output (read) — a free random source with the noise waveform |
| `$D41C` | ENV3 | voice 3 envelope output (read) |

**Gate handling:** setting bit 0 of CONTROL starts the attack/decay/sustain phase; clearing
it starts release. To retrigger a sound cleanly, write the waveform with gate **off** first
(resets the envelope), then with gate on.

Only one waveform bit should normally be set at a time; combining them on a 6581 produces
undefined (though sometimes musically useful) output.

The 6581 and 8580 filters differ substantially — a cutoff sweep tuned on one sounds wrong on
the other. VICE models both; `x64sc` defaults to 6581.

Registers are mirrored every `$20` through `$D400-$D7FF`. Reading write-only registers
returns junk, so keep a shadow copy in RAM if you need to read-modify-write.

## CIA 1 — `$DC00-$DC0F` (keyboard, joystick, IRQ source)

| Addr | Register |
|---|---|
| `$DC00` | Port A — keyboard **row** select (write, active low) / joystick 2 |
| `$DC01` | Port B — keyboard **column** read (active low) / joystick 1 |
| `$DC02` | DDR A — set to `$FF` (output) to scan the keyboard |
| `$DC03` | DDR B — set to `$00` (input) to scan the keyboard |
| `$DC04/05` | Timer A lo/hi |
| `$DC06/07` | Timer B lo/hi |
| `$DC08-0B` | Time of day: tenths, seconds, minutes, hours |
| `$DC0D` | ICR — read: which interrupt fired (**clears on read**); write: enable/disable |
| `$DC0E/0F` | CRA / CRB — timer control |

CIA 1 generates **IRQ**. `lda #$7f : sta $dc0d` disables all its interrupt sources — do this
before installing a raster IRQ, then `lda $dc0d` to acknowledge anything pending.

### Keyboard matrix

Write a row mask (active low) to `$DC00`, read columns from `$DC01`. A **clear** bit means
pressed.

| Row (`$DC00`) | bit 7 | bit 6 | bit 5 | bit 4 | bit 3 | bit 2 | bit 1 | bit 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `$FE` (0) | CRSR ↓/↑ | F5 | F3 | F1 | F7 | CRSR →/← | RETURN | DEL |
| `$FD` (1) | L SHIFT | E | S | Z | 4 | A | W | 3 |
| `$FB` (2) | X | T | F | C | 6 | D | R | 5 |
| `$F7` (3) | V | U | H | B | 8 | G | Y | 7 |
| `$EF` (4) | N | O | K | M | 0 | J | I | 9 |
| `$DF` (5) | , | @ | : | . | - | L | P | + |
| `$BF` (6) | / | ↑ | = | R SHIFT | HOME | ; | * | £ |
| `$7F` (7) | **RUN/STOP** | Q | C= | SPACE | 2 | CTRL | ← | 1 |

The cursor keys are single keys: SHIFT decides up vs down and left vs right, so test the
shift bits (row 1 bit 7 or row 6 bit 4) as well.

**RUN/STOP = row `$7F`, bit 7** — the conventional demo exit key (see the
`c64-demo-framework` skill).

Restore the row select to `$FF` after scanning so a stuck row does not confuse later reads.

## CIA 2 — `$DD00-$DD0F` (serial bus, user port, VIC bank, NMI source)

| Addr | Register |
|---|---|
| `$DD00` | Port A — **bits 0-1 select the VIC bank (inverted)**, serial bus lines in bits 3-7 |
| `$DD01` | Port B — user port |
| `$DD02/03` | DDR A / DDR B — set bits 0-1 of DDR A to output before changing the bank |
| `$DD04-0F` | Timers, TOD, ICR, control — same layout as CIA 1 |

CIA 2 generates **NMI**, which cannot be masked by `sei`. Disable its own sources with
`lda #$7f : sta $dd0d : lda $dd0d` before taking over the machine (the write masks, the
read acknowledges anything already latched).

**That does not stop RESTORE.** The RESTORE key is not a CIA 2 interrupt source — it is
wired to the CPU's `/NMI` line through a monostable, so no `$dd0d` value can mask it. The
KERNAL handler at `$fe47` checks `$dd0d`, finds no CIA 2 source pending, and falls through
to the stop-key scan; with RUN/STOP also held it jumps to BASIC's warm start, on top of
whatever your demo has done to zero page. To actually swallow it, take the NMI vector as
well (the KERNAL is banked in, so `$0318/$0319` is the one to use):

```assembly
    lda #<nmi_ignore
    sta $0318
    lda #>nmi_ignore
    sta $0319
    ...
nmi_ignore:
    rti
```

VIC bank values for `$DD00` bits 1-0: `%11` = bank 0 `$0000-$3FFF`, `%10` = bank 1
`$4000-$7FFF`, `%01` = bank 2 `$8000-$BFFF`, `%00` = bank 3 `$C000-$FFFF`. See `vic-ii.md`.
